/*
* VARIABLES:
*
* 0. To hold things in memory during the life-cycle of a program, we can use variables.  Variables
* are named identifiers that can point to values of a particular type, like a Number, String,
* Boolean, Array, Object or another data-type.  Variables are called so because once created, we
* can CHANGE the value (and type of value) to which they point.
*
* 1. To create a variable we use the keyword, var, followed by a name (id or alias) for our
* variable.
*
* 2. There are 2 phases of using variables: declaration and initialization (or assignment).
*/

// 1. declaration //
var myName;

/*
* At the declaration phase, the variable myName is undefined because we have NOT initialized
* it to anything
*/
console.log(myName); // prints => undefined

// 2. initialization or assignment //
myName = 'john';
console.log(myName); // prints => john

// 3. re-assignment //
myName = 'bob';
console.log(myName); // prints => bob

// NOTE: We can assign and re-assign anything to a variable - we cannot do this with constants //
var myVariable = 1;
var myVariable = true;
myVariable = "someString";

//Creating a variable using the let keyword
let variable = 100; //variables defined with let are block scoped and therefore cannot be changed outside of the scope that created them


//Variables can also be defined in other ways 
//For example a constant is defined with the const keyword and cannot be modified after initialization
const x = 10; //x will always be 10

const y = x; //const can be used for assignment but cannot change values itself 

//x = 20; this code would return an error saying that the value cannot be modified
